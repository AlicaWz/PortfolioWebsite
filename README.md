# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my very first portfolio website! What you see here is the MVP, so it's far from being finished. I plan to add new features over time and experiment a bit. Here’s what you can expect:

1. `Code Cleanup`: Tidying up and adding more tokens to simplify and unify elements like spacing, font sizes, and more.
2. `Projects`: Essentially the heart of any portfolio website! I need to prepare and showcase the cases I want to feature here.
3. `Animations`: Right now, the page feels quite static. I want to experiment with scroll animations to make it feel more dynamic and alive.

These are the main points for now, but I’m sure more ideas will come along the way. Stay tuned!
